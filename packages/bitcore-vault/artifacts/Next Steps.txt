1) Integrate security protocol into secure process
withVaultAccess is a HOF that unlocks, calls a super method, and then finally writes over the provided password buffer & locks the wallet
** note ** wallet lock is not safe

2) Think about observability - if the process exits, it will be useful to determine why.
