## Development

The 18 backend packages under `packages/` (everything except `insight` and the
three nested `benchmark/` fixtures) are npm workspaces of this root, installed
and linked from one root install and one root lockfile. A package directory is
no longer an independently locked checkout with its own `node_modules` or
`package-lock.json` — you cannot `cd packages/bitcore-node && npm install`.
This is a monorepo-development-only change: it does not affect ordinary
consumers, who continue to `npm install @bitpay-labs/bitcore-node` (or any
other published package) from the registry exactly as before.

### Setup

Use Node `22.x` and npm exactly `10.9.2` (pinned in root `package.json`'s
`packageManager` field and enforced by a preflight check that runs before
install). Then, from the repo root:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore.git
cd bitcore
npm ci
```

`npm ci` installs and links all workspaces and then automatically compiles
the packages that need a build step (`bitcore-logging`, `crypto-wallet-core`,
`bitcore-wallet-service`, `bitcore-wallet-client`, `bitcore-client`,
`bitcore-cli`, `bitcore-node`, in that order) via a root `postinstall` hook.
To recompile later without reinstalling — after pulling changes or editing a
package directly — run:

```sh
npm run compile
```

### Editing a workspace's dependencies

Add or update a package's own dependency with `--workspace`, from the root:

```sh
npm install <dependency> --workspace=@bitpay-labs/<package-directory-name>
```

Internal cross-package dependencies (e.g. `bitcore-node` depending on
`@bitpay-labs/crypto-wallet-core`) are declared as ordinary semver ranges in
each package's `package.json`, the same as any published dependency — not
`workspace:*` or `file:` references — and are linked locally by npm because
the range matches the local version.

### Running and testing

- `npm run test:<package-directory-name>` runs one package's own tests (e.g.
  `npm run test:bitcore-lib`, `npm run test:bitcore-wallet-service`). There is
  no single aggregate root `test` script; run the specific package(s) you
  changed, or see [`ci.sh`](ci.sh) below for the full matrix used in CI.
- `npm run watch` runs bitcore-client's TypeScript watcher.
- `npm run node` / `npm run bws` start bitcore-node / bitcore-wallet-service
  directly from source.
- `npm run build` builds the root Docker image; `npm run build:docker` builds
  the bitcore-node and bitcore-wallet-service images.

### Insight

Insight (`packages/insight`) is deliberately kept out of the workspace graph
and keeps its own independent lockfile and toolchain. Install and build it
separately from the root:

```sh
npm run insight:install
npm run insight:build
```

### Docker test workflows

`./ci.sh` builds and runs the local Docker Compose test stack (application
images plus the per-chain services tests need — MongoDB, Bitcoin, Geth, etc.).
Run `./ci.sh --help` for usage, or see [`ci.sh`](ci.sh) directly.

## Versioning

This repo follows the even-odd versioning convention. Major versions that are even (e.g. v8.x.x) are `stable` releases, odd are `beta` releases (e.g. v9.x.x). Beta versions may contain breaking changes or major feature additions that are still in testing.
