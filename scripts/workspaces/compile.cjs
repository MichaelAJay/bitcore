// Sequential compile runner (acceptance-spec §2). Invokes each compile-
// bearing workspace's own `compile` script, in the configured order, through
// `npm run compile --workspace=<name>` -- never `tsc` directly -- so each
// package keeps selecting its own compiler and lifecycle (CLI's postbuild
// launcher generation, wallet-service's template copying, ...). Stops
// before the next package after the first nonzero exit or signal; this is
// how bitcore-migration-plan.md's Task 1.3 keeps the seven-package build
// order explicit instead of relying on a workspace tool's own topological
// sort (see target-design item 8).
//
// This module is intentionally usable against any npm-workspaces root, not
// only this repository: `runSequentialCompile`/`runWorkspaceCompile` take an
// explicit `order` and `root`, so Phase 1 fixtures can exercise the real
// ordering/failure/signal-handling behavior against a disposable synthetic
// workspace tree without depending on this repository's own cutover to npm
// workspaces (not yet done -- see Task 2.1). Only `main()` below binds the
// real COMPILE_ORDER and this repository's root.

// Signals only the *leaf* live descendants of `pid` (processes with no

// empirically (see artifacts/workspaces/task2.2/evidence.md) that npm's own
// lifecycle code already relays a signal it receives to its immediate child
// correctly on both platforms, but that immediate child is
// `/bin/sh -c '<script>'` (npm always runs a package's own script through a
// shell, since a script string can contain arbitrary shell syntax it can't
// safely skip that layer for), and this project's two supported platforms
// disagree about what that shell layer even is: macOS's `/bin/sh` execve-
// replaces itself for a simple trailing command like `node compile.js`, so
// there is no distinct shell process left to relay through -- but
// Debian/Ubuntu's `/bin/sh` (dash, the base of every `node:*-bookworm` image
// this repo uses) forks a real child instead, and dash does not relay a
// signal it receives on to that child; it just dies immediately on its own,
// orphaning the still-running compile step and hanging anything waiting on
// it. Signaling the leaf directly reaches that orphan-prone grandchild
// regardless of which of those the shell layer turned out to be -- but only
// the leaf: signaling dash *itself* directly (in addition to its child)
// reintroduces the identical problem one level up, since a directly-
// signaled dash also just dies immediately, before it can observe its own
// child's real exit and propagate it -- which is exactly the npm-visible
// signal/exit-code that the runner and its tests read. Leaving every
// intermediate shell unsignaled lets each one exit normally once its own
// child does, so npm's own reported exit reflects the real leaf's outcome
// instead of a shell that was killed out from under it.
//
// Returns the pids it actually signaled, so the caller can wait for their
// real exit directly: npm's own reported exit (see runWorkspaceCompile) only
// reflects its immediate child (the intermediate shell, left deliberately
// unsignaled above), not these leaves, so on a platform where that shell is
// a distinct, real process, npm can finish observing *its* child well
// before a leaf signaled here has actually finished exiting.
